## Progressive Web App

Originally planned for deployment to mobile app stores, Card☆Symphony was redesigned as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to provide a native-like experience without the annual developer fees. The PWA approach offers several advantages:

- **No App Store Dependencies**: Direct installation from the browser
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on iOS, Android, and desktop
- **Offline Capability**: Can be played without an internet connection
- **Automatic Updates**: Users always get the latest version
- **Lower Barrier to Entry**: No app store approval process required

## Game Mechanics

- **Card Reveals**: Visual feedback when cards are selected and revealed
- **Match Detection**: Automatic detection of matching pairs with color-coded player feedback
- **Turn Management**: In multiplayer mode, turns alternate between players on mismatches
- **Scoring System**: Points awarded for each successful match in multiplayer
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Board layout adapts to card count with responsive grid sizing
- **Random Generation**: Card positions, background images, and patterns randomized each game

## Audio Features

- **Background Music**: Continuous lofi soundtrack for ambient gaming
- **Audio Controls**: Toggle music on/off with persistent preference saving
- **Web Audio Integration**: Efficient audio handling with proper resource management

## Responsive Design

The game features adaptive layouts for different screen sizes and card counts:
- **XSmall Board**: < 10 pairs
- **Small Board**: 10 pairs
- **Medium Board**: 15 pairs
- **Large Board**: 18 pairs
- **XLarge Board**: 18+ pairs
